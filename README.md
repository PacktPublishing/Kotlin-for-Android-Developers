## About the Video Course
Kotlin is a trending language for modern Android developers and enables you to build Android apps faster and more conveniently than in Java! This course helps Android developers switch from Java and to Kotlin for Android development; it teaches you the essential Kotlin features you need to know to do this!

This course starts by introducing you to Android Studio where you'll build your first application in Kotlin. After this, you will delve into the Kotlin Toolbox for Kotlin Android Extensions. You will also compare classes and functions in Kotlin and also control flow and loops. We'll discuss some problems in Java and how Kotlin fixes them, and how Kotlin tackles many of Java's drawbacks such as verbosity and null safety. You will also get into exciting topics such as extension functions. Finally, you'll build a Stock Trading app entirely in Kotlin while comparing some parts to Java to ease the transition.

By the end of this course, you will be comfortable developing an Android application using only the Kotlin language. You will no longer be dependent only on Java to do this.
